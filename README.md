# Compute the expected signature of Brownian motion

We compute the extepected signature of Brownian motion and compare against Fawcett's formula.

For this exercise, we are going to use the `iisignature` package for computing signatures. In addition we use `numpy` and `matplotlib` (for plotting).

Prepare a new environment in `conda`, and then do:
1. `conda install numpy jupyterlab matplotlib`
2. `pip install iisignature`
